> Controllers with 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) have both rotational and positional tracking. Unlike controllers with 3DoF which are constrained to orientation, controllers with 6DoF are able to move freely in 3D space. 6DoF allows us to reach forward, behind our backs, move our hands across our body or close to our face. Having 6DoF is like reality where we have both hands and arms. 6DoF also applies to the headset and additional trackers (e.g., feet, props). Having 6DoF is a minimum for providing a truly immersive VR experience.

This beeing said we decided to use 6DoF (six degrees of freedom) Controller components to record and playback the movement of our performers.
HTC Vive and Oculus Rift with Touch provide 6DoF and controllers for both hands. 
HTC Vive also provides trackers for tracking additional objects in the real world into VR.
